# Macy. A WordPress Theme

For `http://thecontentcat.com` a.k.a the lovely cat. This theme is also intended as a starting point for future projects. It strips out a load of the WordPress crap and replaces it with some good stuff. Based on the nude theme - but highly customised from there on in.

## Installation

Clone this and run `npm install`.

## Prerequisites

Node, Gulp CLI and a virtual machine running WordPress.
