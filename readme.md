# Macy. A WordPress Theme

WordPress theme for `http://thecontentcat.com` or the lovely cat. Based on my 'bare bear' bare theme. This is in active development which is why it's not finished and looks a bit shit.

## Installation

Clone or download and run `npm install`. To build the assets once run `gulp` or to watch them run `gulp watch`.

## Prerequisites

Node, Gulp CLI and a virtual machine running WordPress (for local dev ovs).

## Build notes

Need to buy ACF Pro for the following functionality:

- [ ] The image on the left of the page should be editable by the customer
- [ ] The text on the left of the page should be editable by the customer these are the Spanish, English and French heading translations
- [ ] Adding site wide OG and Twitter images
- [ ] Adding site wide meta content
- [ ] Add link to external article for portfolio items

## To do or to be discussed

Use posts or create a custom post type for the portfolio page, this depends if she's gonna blog again. I'm edging towards a custom post type here.
